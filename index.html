    <h2 class="floatright animated foolishIn"> <br> Hi thanks for visiting my page.  I've always had passion for coding but found myself drifting into other fields of work. My background is a Procurement Professional with a focus on supporting Procurement based systems.  <br>
        With the advent of COVID-19, I took the opportunity to delve into my passion and really start peeling away the foggy layers of coding.  A friend of mine (a professional developer) with a rewarding and successful career directed me to the best languages to start with, and so began my Journey.  So far, I’ve received certificates from SoloLearn on HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery and basic PHP.  I've designed, created and implemented a WooCommerce webstore using custom CSS with full integration to social media.  Spent countless hours, approx. 5+ hours a day learning to code, starting in April 2020.  I still have a mountain to climb but I’m enjoying each minute of it and my hope is to find a job that compliments my new passion. <br>
Feel free to explore my GitHub repository, visit my LinkedIn page or just say hi :D
